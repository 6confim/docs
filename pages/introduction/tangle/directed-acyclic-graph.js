Dag Basics:
- Graphs are composed of edges and vertices 
  - Vertices are sites on the tangle 
    - Transactions or bundles, depending on how you look at it
  - Directed edges connect two vertices on the tangle
- Tangle can be thought of as a two-dimensional DAG 
- Blockchain can be thought of as a one-dimensional DAG
Tangle vocabulary:
    - Site
  - Tip
  - Depth
  - Edge 
  - Height
